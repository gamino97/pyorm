* Cursor
It is a mechanism to iterate over a list of results, instead of processing all
the data at the same time

* Transaction
Unit of work for the Database, you can commit (save the changes in the DB
permanently), or rollback. ACID

* Example
#+begin_src python
  Users.find(id=1)# -> User <id=1>
  Users.save() # Must determine when to save new object and when to update an object.
  Users.delete() # Must delete an object
#+end_src

* Things to define

** DONE Model Mapping

** DONE Query mapping

* On creation
When calling Model(), it should substitute the values it passes as kwargs to
class attributes, so when calling Model(id=1).id we get 1, instead of a Field
instance.
